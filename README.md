# Markov Chain Text Generation

This project implements a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains. A Markov Chain is a statistical model that predicts the probability of a word (or character) based on the previous one(s). The goal is to generate text that resembles the style and structure of the input text.

## Project Overview

- **Algorithm**: Markov Chain (word-based model)
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Python standard libraries (no external dependencies required)
- **Task Objective**: Build a statistical model to predict the next word based on the current word and use this model to generate coherent text.

## How It Works

The Markov Chain model is trained on a given text dataset by:
1. **Building a frequency table**: The algorithm scans the text and records which words follow each other.
2. **Generating text**: Starting with a random word, the algorithm picks the next word based on the probabilities derived from the frequency table.

### Example:
If the dataset contains the sentence:
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# vbnet

The model learns the probabilities of words following one another (e.g., "quick" is followed by "brown", "fox" is followed by "jumps"). Using these probabilities, the model generates text by choosing words based on the learned patterns.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akinmosin/INTERNPROVE_GA_03.git
Navigate to the project directory:

# bash

cd Markov-Chain-Text-Generation
Run the markov_chain.py script:

# bash

python markov_chain.py
The script will generate a sequence of text based on a sample dataset embedded in the code.

Example Output
Here's an example of generated text from the Markov Chain model:

## arduino

"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the quick brown dog runs away"
